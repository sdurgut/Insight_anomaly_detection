# Notes
1. I used python3 instead of python2. I updated the command in run.sh file. I am running it as "python3 ...". It is important because as I understand "queue" library has a different name in python2. In both Mac and Linux systems python command calls python2, except in Arch Linux systems(default is python3 here).
2. I used python3 Numpy package to create a friend matrix.
3. I also analyzed the friend list to be emailed with a given degree of freedom. The file can be found at log\_output/emails\_tobe\_send.txt.
